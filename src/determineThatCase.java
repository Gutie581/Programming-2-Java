/*

                    Determine That Case!

Your Java program will perform the following tasks:

1. Using Java Swing, determine whether a character entered by the user is uppercase or lowercase.

2. Inform the user of the result.

3. IF the user enters a value other than an alphabetical letter ( A-Z, a-z), tell the user that you cannot determine the case of a value other than an alphabetical character.

You do not need another method here, just use the main method

public class determineThatCase
{
    public static void main(String[] args) // Define main method
    {

        System.out.println("Hello world!");


    }
