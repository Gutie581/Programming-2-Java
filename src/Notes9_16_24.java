Opening and Inputting Files Input/Output (I/O)

import javax.swing.*;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.io.FileReader;

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
standard syntax: for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
(start; where to go; how much to increment)
" i is iterated"
++ increments last after the code executes. -- increments first.


Sentinel Value


PrintWriter & FileWriter
Create a new file using PrintWriter (puts data in there) and FileWriter (Creates file).
Use try catch block. (Try, Except in Python)
It is a MUST in order for program not to crash on us.
Module 4 code (Lines 133 - 154)

****************** REMEMBER THIS FORMULA!!!!
Class Variable = new SameClass
FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("/Users/burres/Desktop/output.txt");
Class VariableName = new "Object of the FileWriter Class" (Here is my reference point);
FileWriter variable just points to the object stored in memory.
The output.txt is an object of the FileWriter Class.
Use my own path to test it but submit to that path mentioned above. (/Users/burres/Desktop/output.txt
Line 151 - Generalized exception to catch anything. Catch e "everything".

Module 4 (Lines 156 - 166)
